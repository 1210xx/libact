Cost Sensitive Active Learning
==============================

Most active learning algorithms are designed to deal with a specific
miss-classification error. Though in the real-world applications, the cost for
miss-classification varies.
Cost-sensitive active learning algorithms allows 

Active Learning with Cost-Embedding (ALCE)
